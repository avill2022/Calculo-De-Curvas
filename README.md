## Overview

Graph Visualization Tool is a C# application built using Windows Forms that allows users to create and visualize directed and undirected graphs. It provides options to add vertices and edges to the graph, and users can select edges to generate curves for visualization purposes.

## Features

- **Graph Creation:** Create both directed and undirected graphs with ease.

- **Vertex and Edge Management:** Add vertices and edges to the graph dynamically.

- **Edge Selection:** Select edges to manipulate and visualize them as curves.
